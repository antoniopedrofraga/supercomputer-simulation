- Executable files with compiled GUIs, both for windows and Linux (Debian family), were created under ./bin/

- A code coverage folder, containing an html file is considered as the test results document under ./docs/test\ results/. The rest of the specification documents, Software Requirements Specification and Tests Plan are under ./docs/

- The source code is entirely under ./supercomputer/. Apart from tests, which are under ./testing/. Note that the code related with the actual aplication core is on ./supercomputer/src/.

- Documentation is under ./code\ documentation/. A markdown document was created which explains the system API in detail. This document can be easily uploaded to websites and version control systems like GitHub. A doxygen document containing useful information was also generated under this folder.
